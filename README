This creation of the radio was inspired by many radio systems out there, and my close friend Pyxxi. During the creation of this radio, I was thinking about how theirs not a single free radio system out there that does not suck, so I wanted to change that and intern I created this radio system that is fully discord-integrated and does not require a billion configs and one to where you and your members can have a realistic radio system but also one that is fully integrated with discord allowing for freedom of development and actual fun!.
